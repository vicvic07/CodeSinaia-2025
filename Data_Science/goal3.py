# TODO: Set batch_size (e.g., 1000) to control memory usage.
# TODO: Prepare a list of file paths to process.

# TODO: For each file:
#       - Open the file and read event and particle data.
#       - For each event, count positive and negative pions using check_type.
#       - Use batching (e.g., sum per 1000 events) to aggregate results for memory efficiency.
#       - After each batch, add batch results to the totals and reset batch counters.
#       - After all events, add any remaining batch counts to the totals.

# TODO: After processing each file:
#       - Calculate averages and uncertainties for positive and negative pions per event.
#       - Calculate the mean difference, combined uncertainty, and significance (in sigma).
#       - Print the results, including whether the difference is statistically significant.

# TODO: Print the overall execution time at the end.

# Expected output:
# - For each file: averages, uncertainties, mean difference, combined uncertainty, significance, and a statement about statistical significance.
# - At the end: total execution time.

# Note: Batching is used here for memory efficiency, but sampling (storing per-event counts) could also be used if per-event analysis or plotting
